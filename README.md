Cybersecurity Bootcamp Lab Work - IronCircle
This repository contains comprehensive lab work and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges completed through an intensive 10-month cybersecurity bootcamp offered by IronCircle. The program was designed for individuals with diverse technical backgrounds and utilized an AI-enhanced learning platform to accelerate skill development.
Throughout this bootcamp, I engaged with practical, hands-on exercises covering core cybersecurity domains including threat intelligence, digital forensics, network security analysis, and incident response. Each lab represents real-world scenarios and methodologies that are directly applicable to professional cybersecurity roles.
Key Areas Covered:

Digital Forensics and Incident Response
Threat Intelligence and Analysis
Network Security and Traffic Analysis
SIEM Platforms and Log Analysis
Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering
Security Tools and Frameworks

This collection demonstrates foundational to intermediate-level competency across multiple cybersecurity disciplines and reflects the depth of practical training received through the bootcamp's AI-assisted curriculum.
